"""
Serve one or more output ports.

Every message received on any of the connected sockets will be sent to
every output port.

Example:

    python3 serve_ports.py :8080 'SH-201' 'SD-20 Part A'

This simply iterates through all incoming messages. More advanced and
flexible servers can be written by calling the ``accept()`` and
``accept(block=False) methods directly. See PortServer.__init__() for
an example.
