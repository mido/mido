# This workflow needs access to 2 GitHub secrets:
#   - TEST_PYPI_TOKEN: The API token to deploy on https://test.pypi.org
#   - PROD_PYPI_TOKEN: The API token to deploy on https://pypi.org
#
# Both API tokens shall be generated from a user account with appropriate
# permissions on the target project and have their scope set to the project.
#
# The API tokens have then to be registered as secrets in the GitHub
# repository's configuration under the names specified above.
# See: https://docs.github.com/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets

# TODO: Allow the publishing of pre-releases (a, b, rc).
# The "Test installation" step requires a `--pre` argument to install
# pre-releases.
