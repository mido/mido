Mido - MIDI Objects for Python
==============================

Version |version|

Mido is a library for working with MIDI messages and ports. It's
designed to be as straight forward and Pythonic as possible.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import mido
    >>> output = mido.open_output()
    >>> output.send(mido.Message('note_on', note=60, velocity=64))

.. code-block:: python

    >>> with mido.open_input('SH-201') as input:
    ...     for msg in input:
    ...         print(msg)

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from mido import Message
    >>> msg = Message('program_change', program=1)
    >>> msg
    <message program_change channel=0 program=1 time=0>
    >>> msg.copy(program=2, time=100)
    <message program_change channel=0 program=2 time=100>
    >>> msg.time
    100
    >>> msg.bytes()
    [192, 1]

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from mido import MidiFile
    >>> for msg in MidiFile('song.mid').play():
    ...     output.send(msg)


Mido is short for MIDi Objects.
