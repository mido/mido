Code of Conduct
===============


Our Community
-------------

Members of the Mido community are **open, considerate, and
respectful**. Behaviours that reinforce these values contribute to a
positive environment, and include:

-  **Being open.** Members of the community are open to collaboration,
   whether it’s on patches, problems, or otherwise.
-  **Focusing on what is best for the community.** We’re respectful of
   the processes set forth in the community, and we work within them.
-  **Acknowledging time and effort.** We’re respectful of the volunteer
   efforts that permeate the Mido community. We’re thoughtful when
   addressing the efforts of others, keeping in mind that often times
   the labor was completed simply for the good of the community.
-  **Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.** We’re
   receptive to constructive comments and criticism, as the experiences
   and skill sets of other members contribute to the whole of our
   efforts.
-  **Showing empathy towards other community members.** We’re attentive
   in our communications, whether in person or online, and we’re tactful
   when approaching differing views.
-  **Being considerate.** Members of the community are considerate of
   their peers – other Mido users.
-  **Being respectful.** We’re respectful of others, their positions,
   their skills, their commitments, and their efforts.
-  **Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.** When we disagree, we
   are courteous in raising our issues.
-  **Using welcoming and inclusive language.** We’re accepting of all
   who wish to take part in our activities, fostering an environment
   where anyone can participate and everyone can make a difference.
